An important part of the CKAD exam has to do with storage and persistence.

Specifically:

- Understanding the concept of [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/), [PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/), and the notion of [storage classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/).
- Knowing how to create different types of volumes and claims, and how to mount them onto Pods.
- Other ways to provide a Pod access to persistent storage.

The ability to create such resources in this specific environment is a challenge.  At the time of this writing, it's a work in progress.  Adding coverage of this specific topic is something we plan to remedy.  In the meantime, please be sure to review other resources and [sample questions](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises/blob/master/g.state.md) on this subject.
